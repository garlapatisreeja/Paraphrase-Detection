# Paraphrase Detection Project
Overview:
Welcome to the Paraphrase Detection project! This repository contains the code, report, and slides for our comprehensive exploration of paraphrasing in natural language. Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast, this project offers valuable insights and practical implementations.

Description: 
Our project focuses on Paraphrase Detection using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, specifically the BERT model. With a curated dataset comprising 5,800 labeled sentence pairs, our approach emphasizes robust data preprocessing and meticulous model training. Leveraging BERT's bidirectional learning, our model achieves impressive accuracy and F1 scores. The methodology encompasses dataset curation, model architecture selection, and extensive training. While celebrating our successes, we acknowledge limitations in handling certain paraphrasing nuances. This project sets a foundation for further exploration and refinement in paraphrase detection applications.
